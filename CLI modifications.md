# CLI Modifications Documentation

## Recent Changes

### 1. Environment-Aware Dependency Management
The initialization process now intelligently handles dependencies based on the user's environment:

#### Virtual Environment Detection
- Detects if user is in:
  - Conda environment (via `CONDA_PREFIX`)
  - Python virtual environment (via `VIRTUAL_ENV`)
  - No environment
- Added environment validation checks
- Verifies UV installation and configuration

#### UV Integration
- Uses UV's native virtual environment management
- Implements proper build isolation with `--use-pep517`
- Generates both requirements.txt and lock file
- Verifies dependency integrity with `uv pip check`
- Handles timeouts for long-running operations

### 2. Environment Management
- Uses UV's automatic `.venv` creation
- Prevents running in active environments
- Validates environment integrity after creation
- Provides clear activation instructions
- Handles platform-specific paths (Windows/Unix)

### 3. Project Initialization
- Improved project initialization process
- Split functionality into focused functions
- Added proper error handling and status returns
- Provides detailed progress information
- Clear next steps after setup

### 4. Dependency Management
- Uses UV's pip compile for requirements generation
- Implements proper build isolation
- Verifies installation integrity
- Handles dependency conflicts
- Provides fallback instructions

### 5. Error Handling
- Added environment validation function
- Proper timeout handling for long operations
- Clear error messages and recovery steps
- Status returns for all operations
- Separate manual setup instructions

## Usage Examples

### Standard Project Creation
```bash
agentstack init my_project
```

### Using the Wizard
```bash
agentstack init --wizard
```

### With Template
```bash
agentstack init my_project --template hello_alex
```

## Environment Setup

The CLI now offers a robust UV-based environment setup:

### 1. Automatic Setup
The CLI will:
1. Check for and prevent running in active environments
2. Create a new .venv using UV
3. Install dependencies with build isolation
4. Generate requirements.txt and lock file
5. Validate environment integrity

### 2. Manual Setup
If automatic setup fails, clear instructions are provided:
```bash
# 1. Ensure no active environment
deactivate

# 2. Navigate to project
cd [project_name]

# 3. Install with build isolation
uv pip install --use-pep517 .

# 4. Generate requirements and lock file
uv pip compile requirements.txt

# 5. Verify installation
uv pip check
```

## Next Steps

### Planned Improvements
- Add CrewAI project migration support
- Enhance template management
- Add more configuration options
- Improve error handling and recovery

### Testing Needs
1. Environment detection and validation
2. Build isolation effectiveness
3. Lock file generation
4. Cross-platform compatibility
5. Timeout handling
6. Error recovery scenarios
